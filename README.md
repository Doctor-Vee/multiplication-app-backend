# Multiplication App (Backend)
The api service that provides the questions and answers

### Instructions
Nothing much ... just start the application

You can access the Swagger UI by going to this link http://localhost:7600/swagger-ui/

You can try it out on your own without Swagger by entering the endpoint URL in this format  
http://localhost:7600/multiplication/questions?difficulty=hard&noOfQuestions=13&noOfAnswers=5

I eventually deployed it on AWS after following [this tutorial from bezkoder](https://www.bezkoder.com/deploy-spring-boot-aws-eb/).
